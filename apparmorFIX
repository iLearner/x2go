# Modify python_sandbox_env.yml on edxapp, tasks
#
# It will delete the task   "code sandbox | (bootstrap) load code sandbox profile" on edxapp,
# tasks, python_sandbox_env.yml, for the next EDX installation trial ("edx"), it assumes that
# in the previous run of "edx" this task has run successfully, but the installation failed
# because a warning message that shouldn't be there, I hope this issue will be fixed in the future
# and we will not need this fix with an extra EDX installation trial.
#
# Note:   Run "apparmorFIX" and "edx" files one after the other, so it is useful, and do it only
#         after a previous EDX installation ("edx") has failed with a WARNING, on the task:
#         "code sandbox | (bootstrap) load code sandbox profile"
# 
# Note 2: When doing a "yml" file modification, for now I am just replacing the file with a
#         pre-edited one. Later I will make code for strictly modifying the file in question.
#         This is preferable because the "yml" file may had been updated by the EDX Team.
