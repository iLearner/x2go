#  Cubietruck Specific Fixes For Installing EDX Platform
#################################################################

# GIT-CORE DISTRIB_ID Replacement
#
# At the time I did this fix
# "apt-add-repository ppa:git-core/ppa" was working only with the
# "DSTRIB_ID" field in the "/etc/lsb-release" file set as
# "Ubuntu" and not as "Linaro" as it supposed to be.
# I am not sure of the consecuenses of this change down the road,
# but expect this platform-related issue to be fixed in the future,
# so we can delete this fix.
#
OLD_TEXT_GIT="DISTRIB_ID=Linaro"
NEW_TEXT_GIT="DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu"
sudo sed -i "s|${OLD_TEXT_GIT}|${NEW_TEXT_GIT}|g" /etc/lsb-release

# Install Library Dependencies for Installing MongoDB
# 
# The following are required libraries for a direct installation of MongoDB
# from "http://launchpadlibrarian.net"
#
apt-get install -y adduser libboost-filesystem1.49.0 libboost-program-options1.49.0 libboost-system1.49.0 libboost-thread1.49.0 libc6 libgcc1 libpcre3 libpcrecpp0 libsnappy1 libssl1.0.0 libstdc++6

# Change dir back to /home/linaro/EDX
cd /home/linaro/EDX

# Set Texts-Replacement-File variable

# Modify main.yml for tasks MongoDB installation
#
# I chose to install MongoDB Server directly from
# "http://launchpadlibrarian.net/136308685/mongodb-server_2.2.4-0ubuntu1_armhf.deb",
# for which we also need the Client
# "http://launchpadlibrarian.net/136308686/mongodb-clients_2.2.4-0ubuntu1_armhf.deb"
# 
# The following is the replacement in mongo, tasks, "main.yml" of the MongoDB
# installation with this direct method. The EDX standard way to install MongoDB is more
# desirable, but the standard way didn't find a repository key for this specific platform,
# which is:  lubuntu, linaro, raring, for armhf hardware arquitecture.
# Also, I wasn't sure of editing "main.yml on ".....roles/mongo/defaults/" directory.
#
replacetext mongo.tasks.main.yml:1 /var/tmp/configuration/playbooks/roles/mongo/tasks/main.yml

# Modify main.yml for defaults OracleJDK installation
#
# The following is the replacement in oraclejdk, defaults, "main.yml" with field changes
# for this specific platform, which is:  lubuntu, linaro, raring, for armhf hardware arquitecture.
# This corresponding version is "jdk1.7.0_60"
#
replacetext oraclejdk.defaults.main.yml:1,2,3,4,5 /var/tmp/configuration/playbooks/roles/oraclejdk/defaults/main.yml

# Modify main.yml for tasks OracleJDK installation
#
# Version "jdk1.7.0_60" (armhf) of OracleJDK doesnt include "javawc", so I deleted the task
# "update alternatives javawc" in oraclejdk, tasks, "main.yml", which is a standard part
# of a normal OracleJDK installation.
# I don't know if the EDX platform uses it some where else. By now it didn't complain about it 
#
replacetext oraclejdk.tasks.main.yml:1 /var/tmp/configuration/playbooks/roles/oraclejdk/tasks/main.yml

# Make "nodejs" callable as "node"
#
# Looks like the installation calls it as "node"
# I found the explanation of this on the following web page:
# "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14914715/express-js-no-such-file-or-directory"
#
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/local/bin/node

# One more fix is explained on the file "apparmorFIX", which has to be run after
# the specific issue happens.
